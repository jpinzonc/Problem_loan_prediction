# Problem loan prediction 2017
## Udacity's Machine Learning Nanodegree Capstone Project. 

The code detects problem loans in the Lending Club's data set form 2017. 

Detailed information about the project and the code is inside the project's report: Capstone_project_JP.pdf

The github includes:

1. 2007-2015_pred.ipynb => ANN classifiers to detect problem loans
2. 2016_pred.ipynb and 2007-2015_pred.ipynb => sme model, but build to predict problem loans in two different sets
3. Kaggle_competition_1.ipynb and Kaggle_competition_2.ipynb => Models from Kaggle compiled data for comparison
4. Capstone_project_JP.pdf => Report for Udacity. 
5. Proposal => Folder with the proposal
6. data_files => Folder with data files and images.
