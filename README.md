# Problem loan prediction 2017

This github contains a proposal to the Udacity Machine Learning Nanodegree Capstone Project. 
The project attemps to detect problem loans from the Lending Club data set corresponding to 2017. More information and details can be found in the report (Capstone_project_JP.pdf)

The github includes:

1. 2007-2015_pred.ipynb => ANN model for problem loan predictions
2. 2016_pred.ipynb and 2007-2015_pred.ipynb => model used to predict in two different datasets
3. Kaggle_competition_1.ipynb and Kaggle_competition_2.ipynb => Models from Kaggle compiled data for comparison
4. Capstone_project_JP.pdf => Report for Udacity. 
5. Proposal => Folder with the proposal
6. data_files => Folder with data files and images. 


- Data files for 2016 and 2017 downloaded from https://www.lendingclub.com/info/download-data.action 
- Data files for 2007-2015 data set can be found in https://www.kaggle.com/wendykan/lending-club-loan-data (this is the only dataset NOT in this repo. File is larger than 100MB when compressed)
